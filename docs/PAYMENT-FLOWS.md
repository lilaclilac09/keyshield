# How users pay for KeyShield calls

Three paying paths exist. The frontend's DocsSection mentions all three
but doesn't walk the actual byte-level flow. This doc does.

The decision tree from the user's perspective:

```
Does my agent already have a vault key for this upstream?
├─ Yes → call /proxy/<upstream>/... — zero cost to me, my own key is used
└─ No  → KeyShield uses its platform key and bills me. How?
         ├─ I prepaid (most common)        → balance debited per call
         ├─ I want to stream a long task   → MPP (open a metered channel)
         └─ I want zero setup, pay-as-I-go → x402 (per-call micropayment)
```

## Path A — Prepaid balance + on-chain Solana topup

**When:** you have an agent that runs many calls, you want simple billing.
**UX:** open dashboard → ActivitySection → "Top up with SOL" or "USDC".

### Flow

1. Frontend calls `GET /billing/sol-quote?amount_usd=10` → returns
   `{amount_lamports, sol_usd_price, valid_for_secs: 60, payment_address,
   memo}`. The `memo` is a server-issued one-time string that binds this
   topup to your specific session — anti-replay across users.

2. Frontend prompts your Phantom/Solana wallet to send `amount_lamports`
   lamports of SOL to `payment_address`, with a Memo Program instruction
   carrying the exact `memo` string.

3. Your wallet broadcasts the tx, gets a tx signature.

4. Frontend POSTs `/billing/topup-solana` with
   `{tx_signature, expected_amount_usd: 10, memo, finalized: false}`.

5. Server (Python `billing_solana.py`) does:
   - Helius RPC `getTransaction(tx_signature, commitment="confirmed")`
   - Verify there's a SOL transfer from your wallet (the session's user_id)
     to `PAYMENT_ADDRESS_SOLANA`
   - Verify the on-chain Memo matches the issued memo
   - Pyth oracle: fetch SOL/USD price; reject if observed USD value is
     > 5% off from `expected_amount_usd` (price slippage tolerance)
   - Atomic credit: insert `(tx_signature, user_id, $amount)` into
     `solana_topups` table. Idempotent on tx_signature — double-submit
     gets 409.
   - Consume the memo so it can't be reused.

6. Returns `{credited_atoms, credited_usd, balance_usd}`.

**Frontend impact:** ActivitySection's balance card updates. User now
has $10 prepaid; subsequent `/proxy/<upstream>/...` calls debit it.

### Same flow, USDC variant

`POST /billing/topup-solana-usdc` — no Pyth oracle needed since 1 USDC = $1.
Verifies SPL transfer to your token account. Same memo binding + idempotency.

## Path B — MPP (streaming payment, on-chain `PaymentStream`)

**When:** long-running agent, e.g. continuously trading bot, batch
processing 10K records. Per-call x402 round-trips waste 200ms each;
prepaid balance might be wrong-sized.

**Status:** **NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**. The frontend's DocsSection describes
it; `programs/keyshield/src/state.rs` has the `PaymentStream` PDA layout;
the metering / settlement code on Python side is TODO. Spec pending.

### Designed flow

1. Agent calls `POST /billing/streams/open` with
   `{upstream, max_rate_usd_per_min, settlement_interval_secs}`.
2. Server creates a `PaymentStream` PDA on-chain via the Solana program,
   binding agent_pubkey + owner_wallet + rate cap.
3. For each `/proxy/<upstream>/...` call, server records token usage
   against the open stream (no 402, no per-call payment latency).
4. Every `settlement_interval_secs`, server submits an on-chain
   instruction that debits the stream's USDC escrow by the cumulative
   usage * cost-per-1k-tokens.
5. Either party can close the stream (`POST /billing/streams/close`);
   final settlement runs immediately.

**Why faster than x402:** x402 is a 402 → pay → retry round-trip on
every call (~200ms). MPP is a one-time stream-open + per-call usage
record (no extra HTTP). The 200ms savings × 10K calls = 33 minutes saved
on a long-running agent.

**Implementation gates:** Solana program `instructions/open_stream.rs` +
`instructions/settle_stream.rs`, Python `billing_streams.py`, frontend
`StreamingSection.tsx`.

## Path C — x402 (per-call micropayment, Coinbase format)

**When:** zero-setup, pay-as-you-go agent. "Just call the API and pay
inline." No prior balance, no stream, no UI required.

### Flow

1. Agent calls `POST /proxy/openai/v1/chat/completions` with bearer.
2. Server checks balance (`/_internal/balance/<user_id>` from Rust to
   Python). Balance ≤ 0 → return 402:

```
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
X-Payment-Required: x402
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "error": "X-PAYMENT-REQUIRED",
  "accepts": [{
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "base-sepolia",
    "maxAmountRequired": "10000",         // $0.01 USDC (6 decimals)
    "resource": "<the-url-being-called>",
    "description": "KeyShield API proxy — openai",
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "payTo": "0x<PAYMENT_ADDRESS>",
    "maxTimeoutSeconds": 300,
    "asset": "0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e",  // USDC Base
    "extra": {"name": "USDC", "version": "2"}
  }]
}
```

3. Agent (using a Coinbase-x402-aware client) sees 402, signs a USDC
   transfer to `payTo`, broadcasts on Base, and retries the original
   request with header `X-Payment-Proof: <tx_hash_or_signed_payload>`.

4. Server (Python `/billing/topup` with `payment_proof`) verifies the
   payment on-chain, credits balance, retries the proxy call, returns
   the upstream response.

**Status:** **HALF IMPLEMENTED.** The 402 response path works — server
emits the right body shape. The verification step at
`v2-mvp/src/server.py:1067` is `# TODO: verify body.payment_proof on-chain`
— currently any payment_proof string up to $10 credits without
on-chain check. Needs:
- Base RPC client (alchemy or Coinbase) to verify USDC transfer
- Same idempotency table as Solana topup (`evm_topups` keyed by tx hash)

This is one of the Stage 2 work items in `proxy-rs/ADR-002-architecture.md`.

## Why three paths

Different agent profiles want different tradeoffs:

| | Setup cost | Per-call latency | Balance sizing |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prepaid + Solana** | top up via UI | none | manual |
| **MPP streaming** | open stream once | none after open | on-chain rate cap |
| **x402** | none | ~200ms (402 round-trip) | per-call USDC |

A demo / hackathon agent → x402 (zero setup).
A trading bot running 8 hours → MPP (no per-call latency tax).
A person buying their AI coworker $50 of credit → Prepaid + Solana.

## Where each path lives in code

| Path | Frontend | Backend | On-chain |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prepaid SOL | `ActivitySection.tsx` topup card | `server.py:billing_topup_solana`, `billing_solana.py` | Solana SystemProgram transfer + Memo |
| Prepaid USDC | same | `server.py:billing_topup_solana_usdc` | SPL token transfer + Memo |
| MPP streaming | (not yet) | (TODO) | `programs/keyshield` PaymentStream PDA |
| x402 | agent SDK (not browser) | `server.py:_x402_body` (response shape OK) + `billing_topup` (verify TODO) | Base USDC transfer |
